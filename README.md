# BOOKFINDER
### Only scroll once, a shortcut to the books you really want to read
Bookfinder is designed to help users find audiobooks with a focus on philosophical and scientific content. It filters out get-rich-quick and self-help books, aiming to provide depth and substance by uncovering hidden gems in the factual category. Users can create an account, curate their to-read list with intriguing books from the science, psychology, and philosophy genre, and avoid sifting through irrelevant or misclassified books.

## Features
* Fetches and filters audiobooks from BookBeat with the aim to provide more philosophical and scientific content.
* Get a quicker and more informative overview of each book.
* Save books into 3 booklists: Want-to-Read, Maybe-to-Read, and Not-to-Read.
* Remember your choices, so you don't have to scroll through all over again.
